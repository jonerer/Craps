Craps
=====

Craps is a passphrase generator based on the theories of Diceware. Using one of a set of dictionary lists, it can create a suitable pass phrase.
After generating a passphrase, it will also generate a normal case-sensitive alphanumeric password. This is mainly to visualize how much easier it is for a human to remember a diceware-generated pass phrase than a properly secure password.

If you have any ideas for what word providers or what randomness sources to add, make a pull request or leave a comment.

Binaries are in the Binary folder.
To build, you'll have to copy the diceware*.txt-files from the Binary folder to wherever your build assembly appears (typically /Craps/Bin/Debug/)

Now lets the user define what equipment the cracker uses, and what prior knowledge she has. Does she know what word list it's built on, or does she think it's alphanumeric?

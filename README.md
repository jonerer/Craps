Craps
=====

Craps is a passphrase generator based on the theories of Diceware. Using one of a set of dictionary lists, it can create a suitable pass phrase.
After generating a passphrase, it will also generate a normal case-sensitive alphanumeric password. This is mainly to visualize how much easier it is for a human to remember a diceware-generated pass phrase than a properly secure password.

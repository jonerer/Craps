Craps
=====

Craps is a passphrase generator based on the theories of Diceware. Using one of a set of dictionary lists, it can create a suitable pass phrase.
After generating a passphrase, it will also generate a normal case-sensitive alphanumeric password. This is mainly to visualize how much easier it is for a human to remember a diceware-generated pass phrase than a properly secure password.

Binaries are in the Binaries folder.
To build, you'll have to copy the diceware*.txt-files from the Binary folder to wherever your build assembly appears (typically /Craps/Bin/Debug/)
